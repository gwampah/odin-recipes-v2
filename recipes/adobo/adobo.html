    <p> This is a recipe post for Filipino Pork Adobo. It is a dish composed of pork slices cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic. 
        There are versions wherein onions are also added. Chicken Adobo probably the most popular version of this dish, but this one is as good as well. Let me give more information, and let’s get cooking afterwards.</p>
    <p> Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. 
        And I’ve got to say, it’s definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are other renditions of adobo. </p>
