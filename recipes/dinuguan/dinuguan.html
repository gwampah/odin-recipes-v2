    <h1> Chicken Dinuguan (Dinuguang Manok) </h1>
    <img src="./dinuguan.png">
    <p> There are many varieties of dinuguan but most of the time pork blood, meat and internal organs are used in cooking. This dish, the chicken dinuguan uses chicken meat, blood and internal organs. 
        Compared to pork, chicken is cheaper but the only tedious part in cooking is cleaning and preparation of the internal organs. 
        This recipe requires live chicken so you can get the blood but if you can buy fresh chicken blood and internal organs for cooking, you can spare the task of slaughtering the live chicken yourself.</p>
    <p> You can also use the blood and internal organs of the chicken from the <a href="../pinikpikan/pinikpikan.html"> Pinikpikan Recipe </a> for this amazing Dinuguan dish </p>
